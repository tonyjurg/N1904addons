## Feature description

Maximum grammatical difference of this detailed Morpheus analysis against N1904-TF grammtical properties.

## Feature values

A fixed-length string of 9 characters indicating differing grammatical properties. Characters are drawn from:

* A dot (`.`) when Morpheus and N1904-TF agree (including when both values are `None`).
* A letter (one of `l p c n g t m v d`) when Morpheus differs, indicating which category is mismatched.
* The character positions correspond to the canonical order of morphological features shown in the following table.
