## Feature short description

Type to Token Ratio based on morph-tags for all word nodes under this node.

## Feature values

A float number *stored as a string* representing a ratio in the range 0 to 1 (inclusive) where the dot denotes a decimal point, not a thousands separator.

## Detailed feature description

This feature provides the Morph-to-Token Ratio (MTR), which is a measure for morph diversity. It is defined as:

$$
  \text{MTR} 
    = \frac{|\{\text{unique morphs in the text}\}|}{N}
$$
