## Feature short description

Type to Token Ratio based on lemma for all word nodes under this node.

## Feature values

A float number *stored as a string* representing a ratio in the range 0 to 1 (inclusive) where the dot denotes a decimal point, not a thousands separator.

## Detailed feature description

This feature provides the Lemma-to-Token Ratio (LTR), which is a measure for lemma diversity. It is defined as:

$$
  \text{LTR} 
    = \frac{|\{\text{unique lemmas in the text}\}|}{N}
$$

## Visualizing

The following plot compares the Type-to-Token Ratios measured over word form (TTR), lemma (LTR), and morphology (MTR) for each book of the New Testament. The image clearly shows that shorter books generaly are resulting in higher ratio, even though TTR is iself already a normalized measure. To account for this length-related bias there are various methods of normalization. A large number of those methods are made conveniently accessible using the Python package [lexicalrichness](https://lexicalrichness.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#).
